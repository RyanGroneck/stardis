    "One of the main reasons we use Git is because of Git **Branches**. Branches are like off-shoots of main code, where you can make changes to a specific feature or file without immediately worrying about the broader implications of your changes.

    "Its important to keep in mind that when you want to start working on a new feature or change, **make a new branch for that change!** This way, when you make the Pull request to apply that change, the reviewers know exactly what your change does, and the proccess goes smoothly. \n",

For example, the branch name used to make this documentation was `contribution_docs`, so an example from above would look like `git checkout -b contribution_docs`.
